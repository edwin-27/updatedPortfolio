            <p class="aboutme">My name is Edwin Jeffrey John and I am a Computer Science student within the School of Electronic
                Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London.</p>
                <br>
            <p class="aboutme"> My interest for computer science started in year 7 where I started using simple block based programming such as Scratch. Through this,
              I developed my understanding of coding and computational thinking as I developed my own interactive game. This made me to explore coding in other languages.

            </p>
            <br>

            <p class="aboutme">
            As part of OCR's assessment in GCSE, I designed a two player dice game where I had to use computational thinking skills to understand the scenario given and develop the program and test it.
